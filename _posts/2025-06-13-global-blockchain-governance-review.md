**Conclusion**

Global blockchain-based activities governance is adapting to the
mainstreaming of blockchain technology-based activities. In North
America, the approaches adopted so far range from comprehensive legal
frameworks to legislative bills and governmental guidelines. Belize, a
country that once held a restrictive stance towards blockchain-based
activities, is now embracing proactive regulations, and other countries
appear to follow the same path. As blockchain-based operations continue
to take centre stage globally, regulatory responses are bound to
increase, impacting the future of blockchain-related activities trends.
Future series will examine the regulatory outlook of other continents.
